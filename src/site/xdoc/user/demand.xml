		<section name="Demand management">
			<p>
				The demand management is only accessible to authenticated users and by the following url :
				<strong>jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page=crm</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<center>
					<img src="../user/images/manage_demands.png" />
				</center>
			</p>
			<p>
				The demands have 2 status :
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Draft</li>
				<li>Validated</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The status "Draft" allows the user to manipulate the data of the demand : modify/remove.
				When a demand is deleted, its notification will also be deleted.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a demand has the status "Validated", it cannot be deleted manually.
			</p>
			<p>
				The demand possesses a status text that allows the user to define more precisely the status of a demand
				(i.e. "New" or "Ongoing" ...).
			</p>
			<p>
				To each demand, there are notifications. 
			</p>
			<subsection name="Creation/Modification of a demand">
				<p>
					It is not possible to create/modify a demand directory with the plugin-crm.
					You will need a third party application that will send creation/modification requests through
					webservices.
				</p>
				<p>
					An example with two distinct webapps :
				</p>
				<p>
					<center>
						<img src="../user/images/example_crm_usage.png" />
					</center>
				</p>
				<p>
					In this case, the webapp 2 will communicate to the webapp 1 through webservice with the help of the
					module-crm-form. The webapp 1 will receive the requests of the webapp 2 by the module-crm-rest.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Notification of a demand">
				<p>
					It is possible for each demand to have notifications. The presence of a notification is 
					illustrate by an enveloppe.
				</p>
				<p>
					The number that is display beside the enveloppe is the number of unread notifications.
				</p>
				<p>
					The notifications cannot be removed manually.
